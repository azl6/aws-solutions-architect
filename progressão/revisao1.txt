- Kinesis Data Streams

Records coming have:
Partition key - identifier that wiill determine in which shard it will be stored
Data blob - the data itself

Records going have a SEQUENCE NUMBER added, which directs to the shard that the record was stored on

Shards have two capacity modes:
Provisioned: We determine how many shards we want. 1MB/s IN, 2MB/s OUT
On-demand: Scales automatically. 4MB/s IN and OUT

- Kinesis Data Firehose

Receives up to 1MB of data and directs it to destinies, such as:

AWS S3
AWS RedShift
AWS ElasticSearch

Can also direct data to 3rd party or custom endpoints.

It's NEAR REAL TIME, because it has the 'batch limit' of 1MB. If the 1MB data doesn't fill the batch, we'll have a minimum 1min latency

Can also use a lambda-function before data gets transfered, to transform it as you wish

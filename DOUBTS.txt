1) Which services between the following can transfer directly to S3 Glacier?

- DataSync - YES!
- DMS - 
- Snowcone
- Snowball - NO!
- Snowmobile
- File Gateway (S3, FSx), Volume Gateway and Tape Gateway 

2) How does ALB's IP behave? Does it even exist? 

3) Why using NLB in front of a ALB besides givin it a fixed IP adress? Plz understand this deeper

5) AWS Identity Center: Multi-account permissions and application assignment

6) Network Firewall: Activate FLOW INSPECTION to detect intrusion-prone traffic

7) Field-level encryption is used to securely upload user-submitted data in CloudFront

8) RDS enchanced monitoring

10) NAT GW e NAT instance are in pub. subnets... What about VPC endpoints?

11) Remember headers for encryption in S3

12) Where are ALB's deployed? Are they inside of a subnet? Or outside of it?

13) Are VPC Endpoint Interface and Gateway deployed in the private subnet?

14) S3 minimum storage duration before being able to perform lifecycle transitions

15) File transfer protocols in Storage GW, DataSync, FSx, etc...

16) How many consumers can we have per shard on KDS?

17) Routing types available in ALB besides content-based routing

18) OK, I know NAT GW and NAT instances are deployed in public subnets. However, where are VPC Endpoints (interface and gateway) deployed?

19) Headers for encryption in S3

20) Please understand Q47 from JB5

21) EFS lifecycle is really max 90 days? Do we really need lifecycle to transition objects to IA storage classes?

22) Is it only Glacier Flexible Retrieval that have Expedited retrieval type? What about Instant Retrieval?

23) How does S3 Retention Period work?

24) Is it really possible to use a static website in S3 as an origin for CloudFront?

25) How does G.A work
